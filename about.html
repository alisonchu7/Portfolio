            As a Computer Science student at Rutgers University, I am deeply involved in shaping the future of tech and community. 
            I actively contribute to initiatives that create positive change through my involvement in clubs like Women in 
            Computer Science, Blueprint, and Students for Environmental Awareness. Beyond my academic pursuits, I bring creativity to 
            the airwaves as the host of 'Sugarcoated Sundays' on 90.3 The Core, our school’s radio station.

            During my most recent role as a Software Engineering Intern at Publicis Sapient, I worked closely with product managers and software engineers 
            to deliver innovative solutions to complex client challenges. Prior to that, I sharpened my leadership and technical skills as a technical Intern 
            at Millennium Footwear. I honed my ability to lead cross-functional teams, from ideating and launching an official website to crafting a compelling
            online presence that drove consumer engagement.

            I thrive in collaborative environments where creativity and analytical thinking converge to build 
            efficient, scalable, and impactful solutions. My approach to problem-solving is rooted in a deep understanding of all the layers involved, ensuring 
            that I not only meet current requirements but also anticipate future needs.

            Outside of tech, you’ll find me enjoying time with friends, walking by 
            the pier, swimming laps, or discovering new music. I believe that a balance of hard work and creativity is key to making meaningful contributions 
            in any field.
